> AngularJS directives for Google Maps

## Getting started
This is a directive for AngularJS `~1.0.x`.

If you plan to hack on the directives or want to run the example, first thing to do is to install NPM dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

### Building
To build the library after you made changes, simply run grunt:

```shell
grunt
```

If you get errors from `jshint`, just add the `--force` argument.

### Running the example
To run the example page, just run

```shell
grunt example
```

and open your browser on `http://localhost:3000/example.html`.

The various directives are documented on the [official site](http://nlaplante.github.io/angular-google-maps).

Pull requests more than welcome! Enjoy!
